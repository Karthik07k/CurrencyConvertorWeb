# CurrencyConvertorWeb
The Currency Converter mini project in Java is a web-based application designed to facilitate currency exchange between different currencies. Here's an explanation of how the project works:

# User Interface (UI):

The application provides a web-based interface, implying that users can interact with it through a web browser.
Users are presented with options to select the type of currency conversion they want (e.g., from USD to EUR).
There is an input field for users to enter the amount they want to convert.

# Server-side Development:

The backend of the application is developed using Java servlets. Servlets are Java classes that handle requests and responses between the client (web browser) and the server.
The application employs Ajax for asynchronous communication between the client and server. Ajax allows the user interface to be updated dynamically without requiring a full page reload.

# Currency Exchange Rates:

The core functionality of the application involves fetching and displaying the latest currency exchange rates. These rates are essential for accurate currency conversion.
The application may use an external API or database to obtain real-time currency exchange rates. Regular updates ensure that the displayed rates are current.

# Conversion Logic:

When a user selects the conversion type and enters an amount, the Java servlets handle the request.
The server-side logic calculates the converted amount based on the selected currencies and the entered amount.
The converted amount is then sent back to the user interface for display without requiring a full page reload.

# Usefulness and Target Audience:

The application is particularly useful for individuals or businesses involved in financial transactions across different currencies.
Users in finance, business, and stock markets can benefit from this tool as it provides quick and up-to-date currency conversion.
